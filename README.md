# adventofcode-2016

Some ES6/Node-fueled solutions to the 2016 iteration of the killer [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2016/) project.

Some of these answers are surely pretty dumb (Maybe it was late and I was tired, maybe I wanted to see if I could cluster child workers without actually using cluster), but I didn't see anyone else solve that first one in as few lines as I did. Neat.
