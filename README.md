# adventofcode-2016

Some ES6/Node-fueled solutions to the 2016 iteration of the killer [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2016/) project.

Some of these answers are surely pretty dumb (Maybe [it was late and I was tired](https://github.com/JoeBernardi/adventofcode-2016/blob/master/7-rooms.js), maybe I wanted to see if I could cluster child workers [without actually using cluster](https://github.com/JoeBernardi/adventofcode-2016/blob/master/8-hash.js)), but I didn't see anyone else solve [that first one](https://github.com/JoeBernardi/adventofcode-2016/blob/master/1-taxicab.js) in as few lines as I did. Neat.
